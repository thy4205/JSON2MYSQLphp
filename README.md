# JSON2MYSQLphp
JSON2MYSQLphp, (formally just JSON2MYSQL) is a simple PHP script that creates Insert statments that inserts JSON data into a pre-made MySQL table with the help of the MySQLi plugin. A new version was written in python to elimiate the use of PHP and hopefully improve the effiency of the import process.

JSON2MYSQLphp does NOT create the `create table`. The functionality might get implemented but it is unlikely to be my pirorty at the memoment.

The script is designed for working alongside MSSQL2JSON. While it would work for any other JSON file with the correct format, there is no reason to do so. 

## Feature
* create insert statement from JSON file created by MSSQL2JSON then inseert the data into a stuctrually compatible table.

## Requirement
* PHP with MySQLi plug-in installed
* JSON file created from MSSQL2JSON
* Empty Table with columes correctly setup for import
